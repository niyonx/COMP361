  Course Evaluation
</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Assignments (10%)</strong>: There will be 3 programming 
    assignments. You must 
    work on these assignments <strong>individually</strong>. The 
    assignments are all due on the date of the lecture (Friday), 11:55pm (see exact 
    dates on the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> table). A grace 
    period of 48 hours will be automatically
    granted with no penalty (assignments will be accepted until Sunday night,
    11:55pm), but <strong>no further extension will be
      granted</strong>. Assignments must be submitted through
    GitHub Classroom, you will receive a link for each assignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tests and Final exam (90%)</strong>: The tests and final exam are
    closed-book exams and will be conducted on the dates
    indicated on the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> table. In general, you will need to bring
    your own ENCS calculator. There will be no substitution
    for a missed test or exam.
    <p>Based upon the student's performance on both tests and
  the assignments, a provisional course letter grade will be assigned, based upon the following weighting
  scheme: Assignments: 10%, Test 1: 20%, Test 2: 70%.
  However, if the result of Test 2 is better than the result of Test 1 (as a percentage
  out of 100) then the weight of Test 1 will be shifted to Test 2.
    </p>
  <p>
  Students are then given the option of accepting the provisional course letter grade, in which case they
  will not write the final exam, or not accepting the provisional course letter grade, in which case they
  must write the final exam. There will be a strict deadline for acceptance of the provisional course letter
  grade. If no acceptance is received by the deadline then the student must write the final exam.
  </p>
  <p>
If a student chooses to write the final exam then the course letter grade will be based on the following
weighting scheme:  Assignments:  10%, Test 1: 10%,  Test 2: 20%, Final Exam: 60%.
However, if the result of the Final Exam is better than the result of Test 1 (as a percentage out of 100) then the weight of Test 1 will be shifted to the Final Exam. Moreover, if the result of
the Final Exam is better than the result of Test 2 (as a percentage out of 100) then the weight
of Test 2 will be shifted to the Final Exam
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that there is no standard relationship between numeric percentages and letter grades.

    CEAB Graduate Attributes    </h2>

<p></p>
As part of either the Computer Science or Software Engineering program 
curriculum, the content of this course includes material and exercises 
related to the teaching and evaluation of graduate attributes. Graduate 
attributes are skills that have been identified by the Canadian 
Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) and the Canadian Information 
Processing Society (CIPS) as being central to the formation of 
Engineers, Computer Scientists and Information Technology 
professionals.  As such, the accreditation criteria for the Software 
Engineering and Computer Science programmes dictate that graduate 
attributes are taught and evaluated as part of the courses. The 
following is the list of graduate attributes covered in this course, 
along with a descript ion of how these attributes are incorporated in 
the course.
</p>
<p>
Graduate attributes for COMP361 are:
</p>
<p>
Attribute 1: Knowledge-base: Knowledge of a wide array of fundamental 
numerical methods used in Science and Engineering, as stated in the 
course description.
</p>
<p>
Indicator 1.1: Knowledge base of mathematics
</p>
<p>
Attribute 2: Problem analysis: Use a wide array of basic numerical 
methods to model and analyze complex problems in order to establish the 
requirements and constraints on their design, implementation and 
deployment solutions.
</p>
<p>
Indicator 2.1: Problem identification and formulation
</p>
